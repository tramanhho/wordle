This is a port of _Wordle_ by Josh Wardle in Python for desktop. 

Wordle is a game where the player tries to guess a 5-letter word, and gets clues about the correct word as they go along. 

It has an interactive keyboard popup that is also color coded to track the player's current guessed letters. The colors are coded as follows: 

* Green - The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
* Yellow - The letter is in the word, but it is in a different spot.
* Gray - The letter is not in the word. 

If the player guesses a word that is not in the dictionary, the game will alert the player.
